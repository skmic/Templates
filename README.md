# Templates

The is a simple example to understand function and class templates [C++]. 
I have implemented a function template Max which returns max of the two numbers, strings, doubles or any other type.
Also there is a class template for Stack class implemented. Which the Stack<T>, one can create any kind of stack. 
The example demonstrated stacks of integers, floating point numbers and strings.

The underlying data structure being used is a std::vector.
